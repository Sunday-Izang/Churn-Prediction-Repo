#Data Science & Machine Learning Project

Customers are the lifeline of every organization. Every business needs to find a way of keeping their customers because in real sense, 
it is more easy to retain your existing customer than to find new ones.

This project loads and explores a Telco Customer data from kaggle, manipulates and visualizes the data for better understanding and preprocessing 
for advanced analysis and modeling. 


Objectives

I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

- What's the percentage of churn customers and customers using active services?
- Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the gender?
- Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
- Which features and services are most profitable?
- What's the most profitable service types?
- Many more questions that will arise during the analysis 

Way to go.
